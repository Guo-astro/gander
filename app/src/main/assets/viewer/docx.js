 * turn web pages into Word files write, in an iframe whose srcdoc is that HTML, and gives
 * the frame no sandbox. Unsandboxed, a srcdoc frame shares this page's origin, so script
 * in the part would run as the page the moment the file opened. The page's policy carries
 * into the frame and forbids that already; the sandbox takes script, forms and navigation
 * away from the frame outright, whatever any policy says. It is set as the element is
 * made because a frame's sandbox is fixed when its document loads, and docx-preview fills
 * in srcdoc a moment later. The library stays as upstream ships it (docs/VENDORED.md), so
 * the change is made from here.

 * lined up against their paragraph's stops half a second after the document is up, though
 * it sits in no paragraph, and that pass throws on it. That put "Cannot read properties of
 * null (reading 'getBoundingClientRect')" over a lab report that had drawn whole, and left
 * every tab after it unaligned. A footnote marker in such a run is counted twice the same
 * way, so the first note is numbered 2 and listed twice under the page.
 *
 * The renderer makes every element through the h function in its options, calling it as
 * its own method, and its first call is for the stylesheet, before any run is drawn. That
 * is the one way to the renderer from outside, so it is where this renderer is given a
 * renderRun that draws such a run once, as though it were level, and then moves what it
 * drew into the sub or sup the run asked for, the element the library would have kept.

/*
 * Scale the pages so the widest of them fills the screen, for the zoom in the stylesheet.
 *
 * The widest and not the first: a document can mix portrait and landscape sections, and
 * sizing off page one would push a landscape page past the layout width, widen the
 * viewport for the whole document, and shrink every portrait page to pay for it. Taking
 * the widest means nothing overflows and the pages keep their real proportions to each
 * other, which is the point of drawing them as paper at all.
 *
 * That is a trade, and only for a document that mixes the two. Measured on such a one:
 * its portrait pages go from 80.2% of the screen to 76.1%, while its landscape page goes
 * from 103.7%, which is to say wider than the screen and needing a sideways drag to read,
 * to 98.5% and whole. A document of one orientation, which is nearly all of them, only
 * gains: 83% to 98%.
 *
 * The ratio is reset to 1 before measuring rather than divided out of the last one,
 * because a zoomed element reports its zoomed width and two roundings of that would
 * drift. Writing the property forces the recalculation that the read below needs.
 *
 * That reset is doing a second job, and it is the reason not to optimise it away. Whether
 * getBoundingClientRect reports a zoomed element's box with the zoom in it changed when
 * zoom was standardised, around Chromium 128: WebView 152 includes it and WebView 103,
 * checked on an emulator, does not. Measuring at 1 means this never has to know which,
 * because at 1 the two agree. The rendering is right on both; it is only the reading back
 * that differs, which is worth knowing before believing a rect on an older engine.
 *
 * A page already wider than the screen, which a landscape one is, comes out under 1 and
 * is shrunk to fit. That is the same size it reaches today by overflowing and making the
 * WebView zoom out to fit it, and it costs the document nothing, but it keeps the layout
 * viewport at 980 where the overflow route moves it.
 *
 * Not re-run on rotation, where vwFitHeight is. The width this divides by is the WebView's
 * own layout width, which is 980 in both orientations because there is no viewport meta
 * for the turn to reinterpret, so the ratio a rotation would arrive at is the one already
 * set. Checked on the phone: 1.181 in portrait and in landscape.
